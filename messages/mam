**Make Anything Machine** (often called **MAM**) can produce any *freeplay* shape (Level 27+). Though many are designed for Level 76+ as there are never fewer than *4 layers* and a max of *1 missing corner* over the whole shape going forward. This does *not* include shapes with floating layers like <:lvl_20:719463695230697543> and <:lvl_26:764437955754328065>. A **TMAM** or **True Make Anything Machine** is able to make all shapes possible.
